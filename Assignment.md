## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned
1. Concept: Issue-Based Branching
Expectation 👀: I assumed branches were just fancy folders for developers in huge tech companies — not something for my personal site.
Reality 😅: Turns out branches are my besties! I learned how to link each branch to a specific GitHub issue and even name it like a pro (feature/, fix/, chore/).
Impact 💡: It made my workflow super clean. Every change lived on its own branch, and I was able to test and tweak things without touching main. I even felt like a one-person tech team. ✨

2. Concept: Cherry-Picking Commits
Expectation 👀: I thought cherry-picking was only for people who broke their repos and needed to rescue a line of code.
Reality 😅: Cherry-picking is like stealing your own thunder from another branch — on purpose! We used it to salvage commits from messy or duplicate branches without dragging the chaos along.
Impact 💡: This saved my repo and my sanity. Instead of rewriting everything, I pulled in just the good bits. Chef’s kiss! 🍒

3. Concept: Rebasing & Merge Conflicts
Expectation 👀: I thought rebasing was a complicated Git spell that summoned chaos and broken code.
Reality 😅: It’s not scary if you understand what’s happening! Rebasing cleaned up my history and helped when I wanted to "stack" commits in a logical order. Merge conflicts? I fought them with grace (and guidance).
Impact 💡: I now understand how to manually resolve code clashes and keep only what matters. Like curating a personal museum of code history. 🧩🖼️

4. Concept: Switching Branches and PR Discipline
Expectation 👀: I thought you only needed to switch branches if your laptop was on fire (okay, slight exaggeration).
Reality 😅: Nope. Switching branches is the whole game! I learned how to properly git checkout, track changes, and only push PRs when I’m ready.
Impact 💡: This helped me keep every issue isolated, which made merging easier later. I even caught myself correcting PR base branches before hitting "create". 😎

### A. Milestones and Issues

![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-01 at 18 31 38_1ebb0669](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f556b5-4448-4338-bfe7-13c91cadff6c)
The image above demonstrates the number of issues created. The issues are linked to milestones, a label and a project. They help track the progress that has been made while developing and the specific work that has been done.


### B. Project Board

- Screenshot of your GitHub Project Board with issues organized into columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

### C. Branching

The image above demonstrates the respective branches that have been linked tpo the issues. They are 4 in total, exclusing the main branch

### D. Pull Requests

![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-01 at 19 19 58_fabb4594](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9c933ff-f806-49de-a678-bf920c217d29)
Above is an image of an opened pulled request that is ready for merging.
### E. Merge Conflict Resolution

![WhatsApp Image 2025-07-01 at 19 18 53_9931931a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c21f5d2b-4a17-4832-ad08-e55914c93748)
The above image demonstrates a merge conflict. In this case, after changes have been made to a file and pushed to the main repository,the PR is then viewed from GitHub, and one has to confirm the merge and resolve conflicts, and in this case, there were no merge conflicts with the base branch.
